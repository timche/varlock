# varlock

































## 1.21.1
<sub>2026-09-28</sub>

- [#1130](https://github.com/dmno-dev/varlock/pull/1130)  *(patch)*
  Error when an unquoted config item value looks like a function call but cannot be parsed as one (e.g. an unquoted arg containing a space), instead of silently using the literal text
- [#1135](https://github.com/dmno-dev/varlock/pull/1135)  *(patch)*
  Run the varlock CLI with Bun when auto-load or an integration is used from a Bun process, so TypeScript local plugins work there

## 1.21.0
<sub>2026-09-25</sub>

- [#1112](https://github.com/dmno-dev/varlock/pull/1112)  *(minor)*
  `uuid` type now accepts UUID versions 6-8 (RFC 9562, including UUIDv7) and the MAX UUID, and takes an optional `version` option (e.g. `@type=uuid(version=7)`) to require a specific version.
- [#1124](https://github.com/dmno-dev/varlock/pull/1124)  *(minor)*
  `pick`/`omit` on `@import()` now accept the same selectors as `--filter`: `#tag` to import items tagged with `@tag()` in the imported file, and `!selector` to exclude matches (e.g. `pick=[#frontend, !#internal]` or `pick=[API_*, !API_SECRET]`). Previously a `#tag` entry silently matched nothing. `@setValuesBulk` `pick`/`omit` gain `!` exclusions too; decorator selectors like `@sensitive` are rejected with a clear error in both.

  New `varlock.filter` option in `package.json`: a default `--filter` for `varlock load`/`run`, valid alongside `varlock.loadPath`, so a package can point at a shared root schema and take just its tagged items without a `.env.schema` of its own.
- [#1108](https://github.com/dmno-dev/varlock/pull/1108)  *(patch)*
  Fix an infinite spawn loop when `varlock/auto-load` is preloaded via bun's `bunfig.toml` and bun also serves as `node` (as in bun-only containers): the CLI process spawned by auto-load was preloaded too, and spawned another. The spawned CLI is now tagged with `__VARLOCK_CLI_CHILD` and a preloaded auto-load inside it skips resolving.
- [#1107](https://github.com/dmno-dev/varlock/pull/1107)  *(patch)*
  `varlock audit` no longer tries to lex string, template and regex literals while scanning source files. A quote inside a regex (such as `s.replace(/'/g, "")`), JSX text or a docstring could throw that lexer off and silently hide every env var reference after it in the same file. The scanner now only skips lines that are entirely comments, and references mentioned inside string literals are reported like any other.

  New `@auditIgnoreKeys(KEY, PREFIX_*)` root decorator: keys the audit should never report as missing from the schema, for scanner false positives such as a `process.env.FOO` mentioned inside a string.
- [#1110](https://github.com/dmno-dev/varlock/pull/1110)  *(patch)*
  Fix duplicate encryption daemons, and the repeated Touch ID / Windows Hello prompts they cause, when many varlock processes start at once (an MCP host launching several stdio servers, a parallel task runner). Switching between projects on different varlock versions now only restarts the daemon when its binary actually differs, so versions that ship the same daemon share one biometric session.
- [#1114](https://github.com/dmno-dev/varlock/pull/1114)  *(patch)*
  Plugins whose build is split into several files no longer fail with "No active plugin context" when a chunk loads after the plugin has initialized
- [#1109](https://github.com/dmno-dev/varlock/pull/1109)  *(patch)*
  Auto-load and framework integrations now always run the varlock CLI installed alongside the imported package, and only fall back to a `varlock` on PATH when there is no local install. Previously a globally installed CLI could win over the local one when an app was started directly with `node`, so the runtime library and the CLI could be different versions.
- [#1120](https://github.com/dmno-dev/varlock/pull/1120)  *(patch)*
  Fix duplicate encryption daemons on Windows when many varlock processes start at once, which made each daemon ask for Windows Hello separately.
- [#1121](https://github.com/dmno-dev/varlock/pull/1121)  *(patch)*
  `varlock run` now waits for a child's shutdown handler to finish after forwarding `SIGTERM` or `SIGINT`. Previously, in published builds, varlock exited right after forwarding the signal and killed the child mid-shutdown (for example on `docker stop` with `varlock run` as the container entrypoint). `varlock proxy run` now handles signals the same way: it forwards them to the child and waits, instead of killing it immediately, and propagates the child's real exit status. The `proxy start` daemon's shutdown cleanup is no longer cut short by the same exit hook.

## 1.20.0
<sub>2026-09-17</sub>

- [#1087](https://github.com/dmno-dev/varlock/pull/1087)  *(minor)*
  `regex("pattern", "flags")` is now the one way to write a regex, and takes flags as a second argument: `matches=regex("^[0-9a-f]{7,40}$", "i")`. Passing a pattern as a string still works but is deprecated and produces a warning showing the `regex()` call to use: a bare `/pattern/` string in `matches`, `remap()` match values or `@auditExtraPatterns`, or a plain string in `matches`. A future major version will stop reading strings as regexes, which also means a pattern taken from another variable (`matches=$PATTERN`) will no longer work: write the pattern directly. `regex()` also rejects a `/.../`-wrapped argument instead of silently matching the slashes.
- [#1086](https://github.com/dmno-dev/varlock/pull/1086)  *(patch)*
  Skip the process.env type augmentation when another .d.ts (e.g. wrangler's worker-configuration.d.ts) already declares NodeJS.ProcessEnv, which previously caused a TS2320 conflict. Set processEnv=strict on @generateTsTypes to override.
- [#1097](https://github.com/dmno-dev/varlock/pull/1097)  *(patch)* - Reject `@type=enum` with no members as a schema error instead of accepting a type that no value can satisfy
- [#1052](https://github.com/dmno-dev/varlock/pull/1052)  *(patch)*
  Serialized env blobs (`__VARLOCK_ENV`) now record the format version and the varlock version that produced them. Nothing reads these yet: they exist so future version skew between the varlock that resolved the env and the one consuming it can be detected.

## 1.19.0
<sub>2026-09-12</sub>

- [#1054](https://github.com/dmno-dev/varlock/pull/1054)  *(minor)*
  Check that a value marked sensitive can actually be protected by redaction, which replaces it wherever it appears. Values under 12 characters warn. Values under 3 characters, booleans, numbers, composites with non-string elements, and the `@currentEnv` item are an error when you wrote `@sensitive` on the item, and a warning when `@defaultSensitive` swept it in, so nothing inherited from the default can fail a load. For a number, make it a string to keep leading zeros and precision. Composite values are checked per element, since redaction registers each element on its own. A non-sensitive value that contains a sensitive one now warns. Acknowledge a legitimately short secret with `@sensitive={allowShortValue=true}`; it does not apply under 3 characters. Also fixes sensitive values that are not strings, and the pre-coercion form of a coerced value, being shown unredacted in CLI output.
- [#1008](https://github.com/dmno-dev/varlock/pull/1008)  *(minor)*
  Credential proxy: added request transforms, which let the proxy compute a request's credential itself rather than substituting a placeholder. HMAC signing and Basic auth are built in, and plugins can contribute new transformations.
- [#1068](https://github.com/dmno-dev/varlock/pull/1068)  *(minor)*
  Plugin cache: `getOrSet` now accepts a TTL callback, so a plugin can set the cache lifetime from the value it just fetched (an STS session, an OAuth token, a lease). Also fixes plugin caching to respect the cache mode set via the `@cache` root decorator.
- [#1082](https://github.com/dmno-dev/varlock/pull/1082)  *(minor)* - New `domainFromUrl()` function to extract the host from a URL, and a new `allowIpV6` option on the `domain` type
- [#1075](https://github.com/dmno-dev/varlock/pull/1075)  *(minor)* Thanks [@DavideCarvalho](https://github.com/DavideCarvalho)!
  `varlock audit` can now be taught project-specific env access patterns with `@auditExtraPatterns()`, for code that reads env vars through a wrapper like `configService.get('KEY')`. Add `fileTypes=[tf, yaml]` to a call to limit its patterns to those file types, which is also how the scan reaches file types it skips by default, such as Terraform or Helm values. `@auditIgnorePaths()` and `varlock audit --ignore` can now exclude one specific directory, written as a path (`./apps/docs`, `../`, `~/`, or absolute) instead of only a bare directory name that matches everywhere it appears. A path written without one of those prefixes, or resolving outside the scanned directory, used to silently exclude nothing and is now an error that names the fix. Also fixes the scanner reporting commented-out code inside template literal interpolations (`${/* ... */ ...}`) as live env references.
- [#1060](https://github.com/dmno-dev/varlock/pull/1060)  *(patch)* - Find the Varlock CLI next to Bun-compiled workspace executables.
- [#1064](https://github.com/dmno-dev/varlock/pull/1064)  *(patch)*
  Data type fixes. `@type=enum` now matches numeric and boolean members against string values from `process.env` and `overrideValues`, so `LEVEL=2` or `FLAG=true` from CI satisfies `enum(1, 2, 3)` / `enum(true, false)`. `@type=url` matches `allowedDomains` in full against the URL host instead of as a substring, which previously let `example.com` pass an allowlist of `myexample.com`; write two or more hosts as an array (`allowedDomains=[a.com, b.com]`), since a comma inside a single string now errors and names the array to use. An `allowedDomains` entry without a port now allows any port, so `allowedDomains=[localhost]` accepts `http://localhost:3000`; add a port to pin it. Each entry must be a hostname with an optional port; an empty list, or a scheme, path, or credentials in an entry, now errors instead of silently matching the wrong host or nothing at all. VS Code diagnostics for `allowedDomains`, `allowedProtocols` and `noTrailingSlash` were reporting different results than an actual load, and now match. `@env-spec/parser` exports `autoCoerce` so tooling can classify unquoted values exactly as the parser does. `@type=url(noTrailingSlash=true)` now also catches a trailing slash that is followed by a query string or hash, such as `https://example.com/path/?q=1`. `@type=ip(version=6)` accepts IPv4-mapped addresses like `::ffff:192.168.1.1`. `@type=md5` accepts uppercase hex and normalizes it to lowercase. `@type=port` rejects non-integers such as `80.5`.
- [#1065](https://github.com/dmno-dev/varlock/pull/1065)  *(patch)*
  A leak detected in `ServerResponse.end` no longer leaves the HTTP client hanging. The response is finished before the leak error is rethrown (a plaintext 500 if the headers have not gone out yet, otherwise the connection is closed), so a Next.js Pages Router `res.json()` that would have leaked a sensitive value fails the request instead of stalling the client on a body that never arrives.
- [#1066](https://github.com/dmno-dev/varlock/pull/1066)  *(patch)*
  `@currentEnv=$FLAG` can now reference a key brought in by `@import`, including a partial import that lists the flag in `pick=[...]`. Previously the flag had to be defined in the same file, which broke monorepo schemas that import a shared `DEPLOY_ENV`. A missing flag still errors, now naming the import as a way to provide it. An auto-loaded `.env` value on its own does not satisfy the flag or trigger `.env.<env>` loading. A `@currentEnv` declared in an imported file now also carries through a partial import when the flag is included in the filter. Directory imports declared before the import that provides the flag are rejected with an error asking you to reorder.
- [#1072](https://github.com/dmno-dev/varlock/pull/1072)  *(patch)* - Report loading/parse errors before resolving values, instead of crashing with `expected dataType to be set`
- [#1079](https://github.com/dmno-dev/varlock/pull/1079)  *(patch)*
  varlock load/run no longer spawns the native encryption helper unless encrypted values or the disk cache are actually used. Fixes multi-second startup on WSL 2 for projects with no encrypted values.

## 1.18.0
<sub>2026-09-01</sub>

- [#1038](https://github.com/dmno-dev/varlock/pull/1038)  *(minor)*
  Behavior change: schema items that resolve to undefined are no longer injected into process.env as empty strings by auto-load, matching `varlock run` and the documented `VAR=` semantics (so `process.env.MY_VAR ?? 'fallback'` works). `varlock load --format shell` now also skips them. If your code relies on unset vars being `""`, add `# @injectUndefinedAsEmpty` to your `.env.schema` header to restore the old behavior; when set, generated types mark process.env keys as always-present strings (optional enums become `"a" | "b" | ""`).
- [#1045](https://github.com/dmno-dev/varlock/pull/1045)  *(minor)*
  New `domain` data type for validating bare domain names (hostnames), with options for wildcards, single-label hostnames, IPv4 values (for HOST-style vars), lowercasing, and regex matching
- [#1043](https://github.com/dmno-dev/varlock/pull/1043)  *(minor)* Thanks [@app/pullfrog](https://github.com/app/pullfrog)! - Added allowed protocol validation for URL values.
- [#1046](https://github.com/dmno-dev/varlock/pull/1046)  *(minor)*
  Proxy: a placeholder appearing in a request surface its rule doesn't substitute in (e.g. the body under the default header-only targets) is now skipped (forwarded unsubstituted) and logged as a skipped-placeholder audit event, instead of blocking the request. Blocking still applies to occurrences off the named path/param within a body:<path> or query:<param> target.

  The `maxOccurrences` option has been removed. Each `substituteIn` target is now worth one substitution per request, so listing a target is what grants it an occurrence: an API that carries the secret in two places just names both (`substituteIn=["header:authorization", "body:signature"]`) instead of raising a count. A repeat at the same target still blocks. Setting `maxOccurrences` is now a schema error that points at the replacement.
- [#1051](https://github.com/dmno-dev/varlock/pull/1051)  *(minor)*
  Fix "exports is not defined in ES module scope" when using varlockNextConfigPlugin in a next.config.ts file. varlock now ships CJS builds of its runtime entry points (varlock/env, varlock/patch-console, varlock/patch-server-response, varlock/encrypt-env, varlock/exec-sync-varlock) via the `require` condition, so requiring them from CommonJS works through Next's TypeScript config loader and on Node versions without require(esm) support (below 22.12).
- [#981](https://github.com/dmno-dev/varlock/pull/981)  *(patch)* - Fix leak detection missing sensitive values split across response chunks
- [#1035](https://github.com/dmno-dev/varlock/pull/1035)  *(patch)* Thanks [@app/pullfrog](https://github.com/app/pullfrog)! - Fix `encrypt --file` crashing when confirming values to encrypt
- [#1042](https://github.com/dmno-dev/varlock/pull/1042)  *(patch)*
  auto-load and framework integrations no longer pass NODE_OPTIONS to the varlock CLI subprocess, so preloaded modules (e.g. NODE_OPTIONS="-r next-logger") can no longer corrupt its output and crash env loading
- [#1050](https://github.com/dmno-dev/varlock/pull/1050)  *(patch)* - Fix `@currentEnv` from an import losing to the `--env` fallback when loading a directory's own `.env.[env]` files
- [#1055](https://github.com/dmno-dev/varlock/pull/1055)  *(patch)*
  Fixes runtime-provided env vars being deleted from `process.env` when a server boots from the env snapshot baked into the build output (e.g. a Next.js standalone container where the varlock CLI is unavailable). Introduced in 1.17.1, this could take down a service that passes config at boot with `docker run -e ...`.

  Injected env blob reuse now detects .env source file edits: auto-load and varlock run re-resolve instead of serving stale values when a source file changed since the blob was created
- [#1021](https://github.com/dmno-dev/varlock/pull/1021)  *(patch)* - Build with tsdown instead of tsup; published files now use explicit .mjs/.cjs extensions.

- [#1013](https://github.com/dmno-dev/varlock/pull/1013)  *(minor)*
  printenv: new --template flag renders a string template with resolved values (with optional --escape json), e.g. auth headers JSON for an MCP headersHelper
- [#1006](https://github.com/dmno-dev/varlock/pull/1006)  *(minor)*
  Native local-encryption helper binaries now ship as per-platform optional dependencies (@varlock/native-helper-*), so npm installs only download the binaries for your own platform (on Linux this includes the Windows helper, which WSL needs)
- [#1000](https://github.com/dmno-dev/varlock/pull/1000)  *(patch)*
  Exit cleanly instead of crashing when CLI output is piped into a consumer that closes early (e.g. `varlock flatten | head -3`)
- [#1004](https://github.com/dmno-dev/varlock/pull/1004)  *(patch)*
  Ship the Linux local-encryption helper binaries uncompressed. UPX packing caused antivirus false positives (Defender Wacatac.C!ml) during install.
- [#1007](https://github.com/dmno-dev/varlock/pull/1007)  *(patch)*
  varlock flatten no longer needs to detect a workspace root - any @import path that resolves on disk is flattened, including in non-JS monorepos
- [#1007](https://github.com/dmno-dev/varlock/pull/1007)  *(patch)*
  Clearer errors for Windows-style @import/@plugin paths, which are not supported (use forward slashes, or a relative/~ path instead of a drive letter)

## 1.16.0
<sub>2026-07-31</sub>

- [#968](https://github.com/dmno-dev/varlock/pull/968)  *(minor)*
  varlock/auto-load and varlock run now reuse an injected __VARLOCK_ENV blob instead of re-resolving, when it was resolved in the same directory. Set _VARLOCK_USE_INJECTED_ENV=1 to always trust an injected blob (e.g. handing env into a sandbox with no .env files), or 0 to always re-resolve.
- [#965](https://github.com/dmno-dev/varlock/pull/965)  *(minor)*
  proxy run --url now dials its tunnel through an HTTP proxy (HTTP(S)_PROXY/NO_PROXY), so a sandboxed agent whose only egress is a proxy gateway (e.g. Docker Sandboxes) can reach a broker
- [#969](https://github.com/dmno-dev/varlock/pull/969)  *(patch)*
  `varlock proxy reload` no longer requires the schema to resolve in the requesting shell: the proxy validates the edit in its own context before applying and reports failures back, so a remote broker can be reloaded with a bare provider exec

## 1.15.0
<sub>2026-07-31</sub>

- [#960](https://github.com/dmno-dev/varlock/pull/960)  *(minor)* - Add generateOtp() for generating TOTP 2FA codes
- [#931](https://github.com/dmno-dev/varlock/pull/931)  *(minor)* - proxy: `--persist-ca` keeps a broker's CA across restarts so clients that already trust it keep working
- [#931](https://github.com/dmno-dev/varlock/pull/931)  *(minor)*
  Reach the credential proxy from another machine or a remote sandbox, with no external tunnel tool. `varlock proxy start` / `run` gain `--expose` (optionally `--expose=<addr>`) to bind off-loopback and serve a built-in CONNECT-over-WebSocket tunnel, so a client behind provider HTTP ingress (E2B, Modal, ...) can route through it. Enabling the tunnel mints a per-session data-plane token that clients must present (pin it with `VARLOCK_PROXY_TOKEN`), while loopback clients stay exempt and the control endpoint stays loopback-only. `varlock proxy run --url <wss-url> -- <command>` (with the token in `VARLOCK_PROXY_TOKEN`, or `--token`) runs the command through a broker running elsewhere: it opens the tunnel, self-wires the env and CA certs from the broker, and only ever holds placeholders. `varlock proxy env` also gains `--full` (emit the whole child-view env, not just the wiring) with `--proxy-url` / `--cert-dir` to repoint it, for wiring a client manually. New `varlock proxy token` prints a session's data-plane token, so a minted one can be read back rather than scraped from logs; the startup banner now withholds it unless stdout is a terminal.
- [#955](https://github.com/dmno-dev/varlock/pull/955)  *(patch)*

- [#930](https://github.com/dmno-dev/varlock/pull/930)  *(minor)*
  New `varlock flatten` command: collapses the @import graph into a self-contained directory (rewriting import paths, pinning plugin versions) so a single package can be deployed without the rest of the monorepo, e.g. in Docker builds
- [#934](https://github.com/dmno-dev/varlock/pull/934)  *(minor)*
  Proxy: secrets are now substituted into request headers only by default (excluding common forward/log headers like cookie and x-forwarded-*), and a placeholder may appear at most once per request. Widen with @proxy(substituteIn=[...]) using targets like header:authorization, path, query:api_key, or body:client_secret (body always needs a path; use body:* for bodies that can't be parsed into one), and raise the cap with maxOccurrences. This prevents an injected secret from being swapped into a request body, query, or unintended header where it could be exfiltrated.
- [#750](https://github.com/dmno-dev/varlock/pull/750)  *(minor)*
  Add `@dynamic` selector to the `--filter` language (`!@dynamic` selects static items). Decorator-based filters (`@dynamic`/`@sensitive`/`@required`) now scope resolution and validation to selected items, so e.g. a build-time `--filter='!@dynamic'` skips runtime-only vars entirely, including their `@required` checks

- [#937](https://github.com/dmno-dev/varlock/pull/937)  *(patch)*
  proxy client compatibility fixes: minted MITM certs now include subject/authority key identifiers so strict TLS verifiers (python 3.13+ urllib/httpx defaults) accept them; the injected env now sets NODE_USE_ENV_PROXY=1 so Node's built-in fetch (node 24+) routes through the proxy instead of silently bypassing it, and DENO_CERT so Deno trusts the proxy CA; Proxy-Authorization from clients is stripped instead of forwarded upstream
- [#946](https://github.com/dmno-dev/varlock/pull/946)  *(patch)*
  Root decorators (@initAws, etc) now resolve the full dependency chain of items referenced in their args, instead of only the directly referenced items

- [#918](https://github.com/dmno-dev/varlock/pull/918)  *(minor)*
  Report load failures to error trackers. `varlock/auto-load` can now throw the load error (instead of exiting silently) so a reporter like Sentry can capture it. Opt in with a `globalThis._varlockOnLoadError` hook (called with the error and the values that did resolve), or set `_VARLOCK_THROW_ON_LOAD_ERROR=1` when a reporter is already initialized. Default behavior is unchanged.

## 1.12.0
<sub>2026-07-20</sub>

- [#892](https://github.com/dmno-dev/varlock/pull/892)  *(minor)* - Add `@generateJavaEnv` and `@generateCsharpEnv` loadable env modules (typed Env, loader, sensitive keys)
- [#780](https://github.com/dmno-dev/varlock/pull/780)  *(patch)*
  `@encryptInjectedEnv` is now honored when `varlock run` / `varlock proxy run` inject the env blob.

  Previously the setting only applied to the library auto-load path and build-time integrations; the CLI spawn paths injected a plaintext `__VARLOCK_ENV` blob and merely forwarded a pre-existing key. In blob-only inject mode (`--inject blob`), the blob is now encrypted with an ephemeral key carried alongside it, so resolved values never sit in plaintext in the child's environment. This is leak resistance (crash reporters, env dumps, logs), not protection from an attacker who can read the full environment.
- [#780](https://github.com/dmno-dev/varlock/pull/780)  *(patch)*
  Add `varlock proxy`: a local credential proxy for AI agents (preview).

  Run an agent (or any untrusted tool) through a local MITM proxy so it only ever sees placeholder secrets: real values are injected at the wire (bound to a verified upstream TLS identity), responses are scrubbed back to placeholders, and every request is policy-checked and audited. Mark a secret with `@proxy(domain="api.example.com")`; sensitive items are shown to the child as placeholders by default, with `@proxy=passthrough` / `@proxy=omit` escape hatches. Route with host/path/method rules (`block`, `approval`), set egress with `@proxyConfig={egress="strict"}`, and hot-reload live policy with `varlock proxy reload`. Sessions are durable and auditable (`varlock proxy status` / `rules` / `audit`); `proxy start` runs a daemon with a live request log that other `proxy run` invocations attach to. Add `proxy run --sandbox` to run the agent in a sandbox whose only egress is the proxy: a built-in macOS credential + egress jail, or `--sandbox=docker` (`=podman`) to run it in a container while your secrets stay on the host. Preview: on its own the proxy is same-uid and raises the bar rather than being a boundary; `--sandbox` (or a container) is what makes it one. See the [proxy guide](https://varlock.dev/guides/proxy/).
- [#907](https://github.com/dmno-dev/varlock/pull/907)  *(patch)*
  Fix nested `varlock run`: a command-local override (`FOO=bar varlock ...`) inside a parent `varlock run` now wins over the parent's injected value again, instead of being clobbered by the re-injected env blob.

## 1.11.0
<sub>2026-07-15</sub>

- [#873](https://github.com/dmno-dev/varlock/pull/873)  *(minor)*
  Add `--filter` flag to `load`/`run` for selecting env vars by key/glob, `@sensitive`/`@required`, or tags (new `@tag()` item decorator). Also add a matching `filter=` arg to `@generate*` code-generation decorators, so a single schema can emit multiple generated files scoped to different subsets.
- [#871](https://github.com/dmno-dev/varlock/pull/871)  *(minor)*
  Add detection for Railway, AWS Amplify, Google Cloud Run, Deno Deploy, Zeabur, and Firebase App Hosting; detect dev sandboxes (CodeSandbox, StackBlitz, GitHub Codespaces, Gitpod, Replit) with isCI: false; add detectRuntime/detectOs and expose them as VARLOCK_RUNTIME/VARLOCK_OS builtin variables.

  Also fixes several incorrect env var names found during a std-env doc audit: GitHub Actions PR number (was reading a non-existent variable), GitLab MR number (was using the instance-wide ID instead of the IID), Netlify build URL (double `https://`), Semaphore PR number (Classic-only variable), Azure Pipelines PR number (prefers the GitHub-facing number), and Bitbucket repo owner (deprecated variable). Adds repo extraction for Bitrise.

  A second pass against std-env's actual detection logic found three more real gaps: Vercel and Netlify now report `isCI: false` when running their local dev servers (`vercel dev`, `netlify dev`) instead of always reporting CI; StackBlitz detection now also requires the WebContainer runtime marker (matching std-env) instead of a weak SHELL-only heuristic that could misfire; and `detectRuntime`'s `isNode` flag now matches std-env's semantics (stays `true` under Bun/Deno's Node-compat mode).
- [#874](https://github.com/dmno-dev/varlock/pull/874)  *(patch)*
  Fix: `varlock load --format json-full` no longer includes `@internal` items by default (pass `--include-internal` to opt in for local debugging). Framework integrations shell out to this exact command to get their injected config, so this closes a leak where an `@internal` secret-zero credential could reach client/SSR runtime code.

## 1.10.0
<sub>2026-07-06</sub>

- [#849](https://github.com/dmno-dev/varlock/pull/849)  *(minor)*
  Generate code for Python, Rust, Go, and PHP with new per-language decorators (`@generatePythonEnv`, `@generateRustEnv`, `@generateGoEnv`, `@generatePhpEnv`). Each emits a self-contained, idiomatic module — typed coerced values, a loader that parses the injected env, and a `SENSITIVE_KEYS` constant — so it's usable out of the box. The TypeScript generator moves to `@generateTsTypes` and gains options to control `process.env`/`import.meta.env` augmentation and a monorepo-friendly `exposeEnv=local` mode. `@generateTypes(lang=ts)` still works as a deprecated alias. The `varlock typegen` command is renamed to `varlock codegen` (with `typegen` kept as a deprecated alias). Note: `@disableProcessEnvInjection` now requires a static `true`/`false` value — env-dependent values like `forEnv(prod)` are a schema error, since generated code must not differ per environment.
- [#853](https://github.com/dmno-dev/varlock/pull/853)  *(patch)* - Reject unknown or misspelled CLI flags with a did-you-mean suggestion instead of silently ignoring them
- [#861](https://github.com/dmno-dev/varlock/pull/861)  *(patch)*
  Runtime leak detection now catches secrets in compressed responses: gzipped responses that fit in a single chunk (i.e. most pages) were never scanned, so browsers — which always send `Accept-Encoding: gzip` — could receive leaked sensitive values the scanner should have blocked. Brotli and zstd responses are now scanned too, and compressed chunks containing a leak fail closed (the response is killed) instead of passing through.

  Note: since most browser traffic previously bypassed the scanner, an app with an existing undetected leak will start seeing those responses blocked after upgrading — look for `DETECTED LEAKED SENSITIVE CONFIG` in server logs, which names the offending config key.
- [#861](https://github.com/dmno-dev/varlock/pull/861)  *(patch)*
  Runtime fixes: env state is now shared across bundled copies of `varlock/env` (fixes stale values after env reloads when a bundler duplicates the module, including cleanup of `process.env` keys removed between reloads), and `node:crypto` is loaded lazily — with encrypted env blobs decrypting via WebCrypto on edge runtimes that lack it entirely (e.g. Vercel Edge). Minimum supported Node version is now 22.3.

- [#835](https://github.com/dmno-dev/varlock/pull/835)  *(minor)* - Add `varlock keychain` commands to manage macOS Keychain-backed secrets.
- [#830](https://github.com/dmno-dev/varlock/pull/830)  *(patch)*
  Improved `audit` and `init` env var scanning in monorepos:

  - Scanning no longer descends into child packages — any subdirectory with its own `package.json` or `.env.schema` is treated as a separate package and skipped. This fixes spurious results and makes scanning much faster.
  - Pure execution-environment plumbing (`PATH`, `HOME`, `SHELL`, `NODE_OPTIONS`, `npm_*`, etc.) is no longer reported as "missing in schema" by `audit`, nor added to inferred schemas by `init`. App-meaningful vars like `NODE_ENV` and CI variables are still reported.

## 1.8.0
<sub>2026-06-23</sub>

- [#817](https://github.com/dmno-dev/varlock/pull/817)  *(minor)* - Add @internal decorator to mark items used only by varlock (e.g. a secret-zero token) so they are resolved but not injected into your app

- [#812](https://github.com/dmno-dev/varlock/pull/812)  *(patch)* - varlock run now forwards termination signals (SIGTERM/SIGINT/SIGHUP/SIGQUIT) to the child process and propagates its exit status faithfully (128+N on signal death), making it safe to use as a container ENTRYPOINT / PID 1
- [#799](https://github.com/dmno-dev/varlock/pull/799)  *(patch)* - Update gunshi to 0.35. `varlock cache status`/`clear` are now proper subcommands with scoped help and completion, and `printenv`/`explain`/`reveal`/`scan`/`audit` now declare their positional arguments so they appear in `--help` and shell completion.

- [#790](https://github.com/dmno-dev/varlock/pull/790)  *(patch)* - Fix typed builtin vars (e.g. boolean VARLOCK_IS_CI) being stringified when referenced from root decorators like @import/@initOp, which broke not()/if() logic
- [#794](https://github.com/dmno-dev/varlock/pull/794)  *(patch)* - Object and array literals can now span multiple lines. Inside decorators each continuation line is prefixed with `#` (like multi-line function calls), e.g. a long `@import(./.env.shared, pick=[ ... ])` key list; literals nested in item-value function calls use plain newlines. Single-line literals are unchanged.
  Multi-line literals and function calls also support `#` comments — full-line entries can be commented out (`# # OLD_KEY,`) and individual entries annotated with trailing comments (`# KEY, # note`).
  The VSCode extension's syntax highlighting now understands object/array literals (single- and multi-line) and these inline comments.

## 1.7.0
<sub>2026-06-16</sub>

- [#783](https://github.com/dmno-dev/varlock/pull/783)  *(minor)* - Add per-item leak-detection opt-out via `@sensitive={preventLeaks=false}`. Secrets that legitimately leave the system (e.g. an API endpoint that returns a secret to another service) can be excluded from runtime leak detection while still being redacted in logs. The options form also accepts `enabled` to toggle sensitivity (including dynamically, e.g. `@sensitive={enabled=forEnv(production)}`).
  Adds standalone object (`{key=value}`) and array (`[a, b, c]`) literals to the env-spec grammar, usable as decorator values and function-call arguments (including nested). `()` remains reserved for function calls.
- [#786](https://github.com/dmno-dev/varlock/pull/786)  *(minor)* - `@setValuesBulk` and `@import` support `pick`/`omit` key filters.
  Filter which keys are brought in with `pick` (allowlist) or `omit` (denylist) array args — e.g. `@setValuesBulk(opLoadEnvironment(env-id), pick=[API_KEY, DB_*])` or `@import(./.env.shared, omit=[LEGACY_TOKEN])`. By default every key is included; `pick` and `omit` can't be combined, and both accept simple globs (`*`, `?`).
  For `@import`, listing keys as positional args (`@import(./.env.shared, KEY1, KEY2)`) is now deprecated in favor of `pick=[...]` — it still works but warns.

## 1.6.1
<sub>2026-06-11</sub>

- [#770](https://github.com/dmno-dev/varlock/pull/770)  *(patch)* - **Fix:** `varlock run` no longer breaks interactive TTY tools (`psql`, `claude`, etc.). Previously redaction always piped stdout/stderr, which broke raw-TTY behavior unless you passed `--no-redact-stdout`.
  Redaction is now auto-detected per stream: output attached to an interactive terminal passes through directly (preserving raw TTY behavior), while piped or redirected output (CI logs, files, pipes) is still redacted — that's where leaked secrets actually persist. Detection is per stream, so `varlock run -- app | tee log.txt` redacts stdout while stderr (still on the terminal) passes through.
  - Add `--redact-stdout` / `_VARLOCK_REDACT_STDOUT` to override the auto-detection: force redaction of piped output (e.g. to override `@redactLogs=false`). Forcing redaction while attached to an interactive terminal errors, since it isn't possible without breaking TTY behavior. The flag takes precedence over the env var.
  - Fix a leak where a secret split across stream chunk boundaries escaped redaction.
  - Exclude all reserved `_VARLOCK_*` keys from the injected env blob, generated types, and override provenance (previously only `_VARLOCK_ENV_KEY` / `_VARLOCK_CACHE_KEY` were excluded), and scope override provenance to actual schema config keys instead of mirroring every `process.env` key. Warn when a user defines a config item using the reserved `_VARLOCK_` prefix.

## 1.6.0
<sub>2026-06-10</sub>

- [#577](https://github.com/dmno-dev/varlock/pull/577)  *(minor)* - - Add caching system: `cache()` resolver, plugin cache API, encrypted JSON store (file mode `0600`), `varlock cache` CLI with TTY-aware browser and `--yes` confirm for `clear`.
  - Cache TTLs use the shared duration format; `"forever"` caches until manually cleared (the default for `cache()`), setting a plugin's `cacheTtl` to `false` (or an empty string) disables caching, and a TTL of `0` is rejected as ambiguous.
  - Cached values are individually encrypted and bound to their cache key, so entries cannot be swapped or replayed within the cache file.
  - `--clear-cache` always clears the persistent disk cache, including when combined with `--skip-cache`; `@cache=disk` warns when used in CI or with the file-based encryption fallback.
  - Add random value generators backed by `node:crypto`: `randomNum()` (integer by default, float when `precision` is set), `randomUuid()`, `randomHex()` (string-length by default, `bytes=true` for byte-length), `randomString()` (uses rejection sampling for unbiased output across any charset).
  - Add `duration` data type: accepts flexible string/number input (`"1h"`, `"30m"`, `"500ms"`, `2000`, `"2days"`) and coerces to a number in a configurable output unit (`ms` default; `seconds`, `minutes`, `hours`, `days`, `weeks`). Only plain decimal number formats are accepted, and sub-millisecond durations are rejected. Same parser is used by `cache(..., ttl=...)` and the plugin `cacheTtl` option.
  - When `_VARLOCK_CACHE_KEY` is set (e.g. as a CI secret; same format as `_VARLOCK_ENV_KEY`, but a separate var since that one can be ephemeral), `auto` cache mode uses a disk cache encrypted with that key instead of falling back to memory — enabling shared caching across CI processes without the key ever touching disk. Each key gets its own cache file, named by key fingerprint.
  - `@cache` can be set dynamically with functions (e.g. `@cache=forEnv(dev, "disk")`); invalid resolved values surface as schema errors.
  - Plaintext is passed to the native encryption binary via stdin instead of argv so it never appears in process listings (the macOS enclave binary gained `--data-stdin` support); debug logging no longer includes encrypt/decrypt payloads.
  - Plugin opt-in caching via `cacheTtl` is documented per plugin — see the plugin packages' own changelogs.
- [#757](https://github.com/dmno-dev/varlock/pull/757)  *(patch)* Thanks [@yinjs](https://github.com/yinjs)! - fix: treat whitespace-only lines as blank lines instead of throwing a parse error

  Only real upstream overrides now propagate through nesting, while inner command-local overrides still win as expected.
  Also fixes smoke-test CLI resolution to use the workspace-local varlock CLI instead of any globally installed binary.
  Note: `__VARLOCK_ENV` now includes override provenance metadata (`__varlockOverrideMeta`). Tooling that strictly validates that blob shape should allow unknown/new fields.

This is useful for scanning build output folders (e.g. `dist`, `.next`) to ensure no secrets leaked into what will be published.

  varlock scan ./dist             # Scan a specific build output directory
  varlock scan ./dist ./public    # Scan multiple directories
  varlock scan './dist/**/*.js'   # Scan files matching a glob pattern
  ```
  When explicit paths are provided, git-aware filtering (`--staged`, `--include-ignored`) is bypassed, and build-output directories that are normally skipped (such as `dist`, `.next`, `build`) are scanned without restriction.
## 0.9.0

### Minor Changes

- [#615](https://github.com/dmno-dev/varlock/pull/615) [`9c38e3a`](https://github.com/dmno-dev/varlock/commit/9c38e3a06977263a43a35aafdd07c8ba4253a6e0) - Add `--no-inject-graph` CLI flag to `varlock run` to opt out of injecting the `__VARLOCK_ENV` serialized config graph into the child process environment. This prevents sensitive values from being exposed via environment inspection (e.g., `env`, `printenv`) in interactive shells, long-lived processes, or LLM-driven agents.

### Patch Changes

- [#627](https://github.com/dmno-dev/varlock/pull/627) [`f93c23f`](https://github.com/dmno-dev/varlock/commit/f93c23f15d1cb98f64c2d78de1184fb4edbe5582) - Fix: escape `*/` sequences in item descriptions to prevent premature JSDoc comment closure in generated TypeScript types

  `scanForLeaks` now detects secrets in `Uint8Array`, `ArrayBufferView`, and `ArrayBuffer` values. Previously these fell through unscanned, so secrets returned as binary-encoded response bodies (common in Cloudflare Workers) were not caught.

## 0.8.2

### Patch Changes

- [#620](https://github.com/dmno-dev/varlock/pull/620) [`0f3ca3b`](https://github.com/dmno-dev/varlock/commit/0f3ca3be2231cae9e6f12ee8a6fdebb180a76baf) - Fix regex literal parsing ambiguity with file paths

  Removed grammar-level regex literal (`/pattern/`) parsing which caused paths like `/folder/foo/bar` to be incorrectly parsed as regex patterns. Regex-like strings are now detected at runtime by specific consumers (`remap()` match values, `matches` type option) instead of at the grammar level. Unquoted strings that look like `/pattern/flags` are treated as regex in those contexts; wrap in quotes to force literal string matching.

- [#618](https://github.com/dmno-dev/varlock/pull/618) [`0db7d1d`](https://github.com/dmno-dev/varlock/commit/0db7d1dcd3999578f45f81c90ba39bff6daf4cae) - Fix `varlock run` on Windows: correctly build the cmd.exe command string when spawning `.cmd`/`.bat` files

  Previously, individual arguments were double-quoted separately (e.g. `"tsx.cmd" "watch" "src/index.ts"`). Because cmd.exe's `/s /c` strips only the **first and last** quote from the entire command string, this left a stray `"` after the command name, causing errors like "The system cannot find the path specified."

  The fix wraps the entire inner command string in a single pair of outer quotes (e.g. `"tsx.cmd watch src/index.ts"`), which is what cmd.exe expects. Paths or arguments that contain spaces are individually quoted inside those outer quotes.

  Additionally, when `findCommand` cannot resolve a bare command name to a `.cmd`/`.bat` path, varlock now falls back to routing through cmd.exe so that Windows PATHEXT lookups (e.g. `tsx` → `tsx.cmd`, `pnpm` → `pnpm.cmd`) are handled automatically.

### Patch Changes

- [#583](https://github.com/dmno-dev/varlock/pull/583) [`f640d08`](https://github.com/dmno-dev/varlock/commit/f640d081088feaa88fd9e855b3cc815cc271b08b) - Builtin vars now have proper types: `VARLOCK_IS_CI` is now a `boolean` (was a string `"true"`/`"false"`), and `VARLOCK_BUILD_URL` is now a `url` type. String builtin vars remain unchanged.

- [#581](https://github.com/dmno-dev/varlock/pull/581) [`8337445`](https://github.com/dmno-dev/varlock/commit/83374450753a1c1093120ed591f0c1d4c2bf71cf) - Fix `varlock init` crashing on Linux when git is not installed.

  When `git` is not found in PATH, Node.js `spawn` fires an `error` event with a native ENOENT error that has no `.data` property. The `checkIsFileGitIgnored` utility was trying to call `.includes()` on the undefined `.data` value before reaching the ENOENT check, causing a `TypeError` that crashed the `init` command.

  The fix reorders the error checks to handle the ENOENT case first, and uses optional chaining on the `errorOutput` value throughout for additional safety.

- [#575](https://github.com/dmno-dev/varlock/pull/575) [`349d517`](https://github.com/dmno-dev/varlock/commit/349d517ee9bd84e12c4e7715e23b7fa2074a6f28) - Fix terminal colors when running commands with redaction enabled. When `varlock run` pipes stdout/stderr for redaction, it now automatically injects `FORCE_COLOR` into the child process environment when the parent terminal is a TTY. This preserves color output for tools using color libraries (chalk, kleur, etc.) while keeping redaction active.

- [#571](https://github.com/dmno-dev/varlock/pull/571) [`f582766`](https://github.com/dmno-dev/varlock/commit/f58276693e26d384397c737946cb8111a64877e5) - Support multiple `loadPath` entries in `package.json` configuration.

  The `varlock.loadPath` option in `package.json` now accepts an array of paths in addition to a single string. When an array is provided, all paths are loaded and their environment variables are combined. Later entries in the array take higher precedence when the same variable is defined in multiple locations.

  ```json title="package.json"
  {
    "varlock": {
      "loadPath": ["./apps/my-package/envs/", "./apps/other-package/envs/"]
    }
  }
  ```

  This is particularly useful in monorepos where different packages each have their own `.env` files.

### Patch Changes

- [#538](https://github.com/dmno-dev/varlock/pull/538) [`2022ef7`](https://github.com/dmno-dev/varlock/commit/2022ef7c8b2070f40c0cd787f0cc75a595a679e4) - feat: allow 3rd party plugins

  Third-party (non-`@varlock/*`) plugins are now supported:

  - **JavaScript projects**: Any plugin installed in `node_modules` via `package.json` is automatically trusted and can be used without restriction.
  - **Standalone binary**: When downloading a third-party plugin from npm for the first time, Varlock will prompt for interactive confirmation. Once confirmed and cached, subsequent runs skip the prompt. Non-interactive environments (CI/piped) will receive a clear error message instructing the user to confirm interactively or install via `package.json`.

- [#534](https://github.com/dmno-dev/varlock/pull/534) [`74752a3`](https://github.com/dmno-dev/varlock/commit/74752a3db9459538b8ef7d984737f5bb55de17ae) - Add version mismatch detection between standalone binary and local node_modules install

  When running the standalone binary (installed via homebrew/curl), varlock now checks if a different version is installed in the project's node_modules. If a version mismatch is detected, a warning is displayed suggesting users update the binary or use the locally installed version instead. This helps prevent confusing errors caused by running mismatched versions.

- [#560](https://github.com/dmno-dev/varlock/pull/560) [`0ea6641`](https://github.com/dmno-dev/varlock/commit/0ea66411604966f744e311fdf59df71d5a3da127) - Add `varlock explain ITEM_KEY` command and override indicators in `varlock load` output.

  **Override indicators**: When a config item's value comes from a `process.env` override rather than its file-based definitions, `varlock load` now shows a yellow indicator on that item. This helps users understand why their resolver functions (e.g. `op()`) are not being called.

  **`varlock explain` command**: Shows detailed information about how a single config item is resolved, including all definitions and sources in priority order, which source is active, whether a process.env override is in effect (and what would be used without it), decorators, type info, and documentation links.

- [#553](https://github.com/dmno-dev/varlock/pull/553) [`6ab2d31`](https://github.com/dmno-dev/varlock/commit/6ab2d31903b80ab4d8ec0eb826a18789e73e8f11) - Fix diamond dependency handling when the same schema is imported via multiple paths. Previously, duplicate imports caused plugin init decorators to run twice ("Instance already initialized" error). Now, duplicate imports create lightweight `ImportAliasSource` nodes that appear at the correct precedence position without re-initializing the source. This correctly handles different importKeys subsets across import sites and preserves override semantics matching non-deduplicated behavior. Also adds `type` field to serialized source entries for easier filtering.

- [#558](https://github.com/dmno-dev/varlock/pull/558) [`01c9a6a`](https://github.com/dmno-dev/varlock/commit/01c9a6a5398d31d3818953dd757d3263e0cf3a36) - Fix plugin resolution failure in monorepo workspaces where `.git` and the lockfile coexist in the same directory.

  `detectWorkspaceInfo()` was checking for a `.git` directory **after** moving to the parent, so in the standard monorepo layout (`monorepo-root/.git` + `monorepo-root/bun.lock`) the root was never scanned and the lockfile was never found. Moving the `.git` boundary check to **before** moving up ensures the git-root directory is always scanned first.

- [#547](https://github.com/dmno-dev/varlock/pull/547) [`1a4b0cf`](https://github.com/dmno-dev/varlock/commit/1a4b0cf4185c4152be4b39c70755316f1a8be25d) - Fix binary resolution in monorepos when `cwd` differs from the package root.

  When importing `varlock/auto-load` (e.g. from a `playwright.config.ts` in a monorepo sub-package), VS Code and similar tools may set `process.cwd()` to the workspace root rather than the sub-package directory. This caused `execSyncVarlock` to search for the `varlock` binary starting at the workspace root and fail to find it when it was only installed in a sub-package's `node_modules/.bin`.

  Two fixes are applied:

  1. `execSyncVarlock` now accepts a `callerDir` option. When provided, the binary search walks up from `callerDir` before falling back to `process.cwd()`. `auto-load.ts` passes `import.meta.dirname` so the search always starts from inside the varlock package itself, which is already in the correct sub-package's `node_modules`.

  2. The walk-up logic no longer throws immediately when it finds a `node_modules/.bin` directory that does not contain varlock. It now continues walking up, allowing the search to find varlock installed at a higher or lower level of a monorepo.

- [#550](https://github.com/dmno-dev/varlock/pull/550) [`0c27ed1`](https://github.com/dmno-dev/varlock/commit/0c27ed10b3b77571848974a3703d77e1eabb8abd) - Fix `@generateTypes` not creating variables when using a custom path with `varlock typegen --path <file>`

  When a schema file with an environment-qualifier-like name (e.g. `.env.infra.schema`) was passed as the explicit entry point via `--path`, its variables were being excluded from type generation. The filename was parsed such that `infra` was treated as an environment name (`applyForEnv='infra'`), causing the data source to be marked as environment-specific and all its variables to be filtered out.

  The fix ensures that a file loaded as the root entry point (no parent data source) is never treated as environment-specific, even if its filename contains an environment qualifier.

## 0.7.0

### Minor Changes

- [#483](https://github.com/dmno-dev/varlock/pull/483) [`ba61adb`](https://github.com/dmno-dev/varlock/commit/ba61adb19bd5516f0b48827b386fd7170afe66b5) - Add support for single-file ESM and TypeScript plugins, and improve the plugin authoring API.

  **New: ESM and TypeScript single-file plugins**

  Single-file plugins can now be written as `.mjs` or `.ts` files in addition to `.js`/`.cjs`. TypeScript plugins require Bun.

  **Improved: explicit `plugin` import instead of injected global**

  Plugin authors should now import `plugin` explicitly from `varlock/plugin-lib` rather than relying on the injected global:

  ```js
  // CJS plugin (.js / .cjs)
  const { plugin } = require("varlock/plugin-lib");

  // ESM plugin (.mjs / .ts)
  import { plugin } from "varlock/plugin-lib";
  ```

  This works in both regular installs and SEA binary builds. Error classes (`ValidationError`, `CoercionError`, etc.) are also now directly importable from `varlock/plugin-lib`.

  **Breaking change:** the implicit `plugin` global is no longer injected into CJS plugin modules. Existing plugins must add `const { plugin } = require('varlock/plugin-lib')`.

The bun-compiled binary dynamically links against these C++ runtime libraries, which are now installed in the Docker image via `apk add libstdc++`.

- [#507](https://github.com/dmno-dev/varlock/pull/507) [`76c17f8`](https://github.com/dmno-dev/varlock/commit/76c17f8506fb0bd53b5b8d1a87dae25ab517a1ee) - Fix @import(enabled=...) and @disable conditions not seeing values from .env, .env.local, and env-specific files

  Previously, import conditions and imported file @disable decorators were evaluated during .env.schema's initialization, before other files (.env, .env.local, .env.ENV, .env.ENV.local) were loaded. This meant that variables set in those files were not available when resolving conditions like `enabled=eq($AUTH_MODE, "azure")` or `@disable=not(eq($AUTH_MODE, "azure"))`.

  Now, DirectoryDataSource loads all auto-loaded files first (registering their config items), then processes imports in a separate pass. This ensures all file values are available when import/disable conditions are evaluated.

- [#495](https://github.com/dmno-dev/varlock/pull/495) [`7f32751`](https://github.com/dmno-dev/varlock/commit/7f327511f8be6a1a3d11e0327adc5d95e2805ad3) - Fix: error messages in `varlock load` now go to stderr instead of stdout.

  Previously, error output from `checkForSchemaErrors` and `checkForConfigErrors` was written to stdout via `console.log`, which polluted the JSON output when using `--format json-full`. This caused `import 'varlock/config'` to fail with a JSON parse error when a plugin (e.g. AWS secrets) encountered an error. Error messages are now written to stderr, keeping stdout clean for JSON output.

  Values are now wrapped in single quotes instead of double quotes, preventing shell injection via backticks, `$()` subshell syntax, and variable expansion (`$VAR`). Single quotes within values are safely escaped using the `'\''` sequence.

## 0.6.3

### Patch Changes

- [#453](https://github.com/dmno-dev/varlock/pull/453) [`bb1c075`](https://github.com/dmno-dev/varlock/commit/bb1c0755dc826a7322ecbbfa26c01c1b99f2bcb1) - Add support for configuring the default env file load path via `package.json`.

  You can now set a `varlock.loadPath` key in your `package.json` to configure the default path used when loading `.env` files:

  ```json title="package.json"
  {
    "varlock": {
      "loadPath": "./envs/"
    }
  }
  ```

  This is useful when you store your `.env` files in a custom directory (e.g., when using Vite's `envDir` option). The CLI `--path` flag continues to override this setting when provided.

  The Vite integration will also now show a warning if `envDir` is set in your Vite config, with instructions to use `varlock.loadPath` in `package.json` instead.

  Warning errors (e.g., deprecated syntax warnings) were incorrectly treated as hard errors in several places, causing early bail-outs that prevented plugins from loading and items from resolving. Fixed `isValid`, `finishLoad`, and decorator `resolve` checks to filter out warnings.

  Previously plugins were built as ESM and the loader performed a fragile regex-based ESM→CJS transformation. Plugins now build as CJS directly and are loaded via `new Function` in the main runtime context, which avoids both the ESM parse errors and Node.js internal assertion failures (e.g. `DOMException` lazy getter crashing in vm sandbox contexts).

  feat: add `standardVars` plugin property for automatic env var detection warnings

  Plugins can now declaratively set `plugin.standardVars` to define well-known env vars they use. The loading infrastructure automatically checks for these vars in the environment and shows non-blocking warnings (in pretty output or on failure) when they are detected but not wired into the schema or plugin decorator. Green highlighting indicates items that need to be added.

  - **New `ifs()` function**: Excel-style conditional that evaluates condition/value pairs and returns the value for the first truthy condition. An optional trailing default value is used when no condition matches.

    ```env-spec

    ```env-spec
    # new preferred syntax (match first, result second)
    APP_ENV=remap($CI_BRANCH, "main", production, regex(.*), preview, undefined, development)

## 0.4.1

### Patch Changes

- [#358](https://github.com/dmno-dev/varlock/pull/358) [`c7e2d7a`](https://github.com/dmno-dev/varlock/commit/c7e2d7a752e53a1bbb30fddf4fb88e7834d47be3) - Add `shell` output format to `varlock load` command. `--format shell` outputs `export KEY=VALUE` lines suitable for `eval` or sourcing into the current shell session, enabling easy integration with tools like [direnv](https://direnv.net/).

- [#371](https://github.com/dmno-dev/varlock/pull/371) [`1b9797e`](https://github.com/dmno-dev/varlock/commit/1b9797ed339b6b9955d5356da4f29517d23dfea3) - Fix dynamic `@required` being incorrectly resolved after type generation runs.

  When `generateTypesIfNeeded()` ran before `resolveEnvValues()` (as it does in the CLI), `getTypeGenInfo()` would call `resolve()` on dynamic decorators like `@required=eq($OTHER, foo)` before their dependencies were resolved. This cached a stale result on the decorator, causing `processRequired()` to return the wrong value when env values were later resolved.

  The fix skips calling `resolve()` for dynamic decorators in `getTypeGenInfo()` — their runtime value is irrelevant for type generation anyway (dynamic required items are always typed as optional).

- [#364](https://github.com/dmno-dev/varlock/pull/364) [`78307f9`](https://github.com/dmno-dev/varlock/commit/78307f987dbc25a3c0565b6739802e9f06a8305a) - fix: `varlock printenv MY_VAR` was failing with `Variable "printenv" not found in schema` because gunshi includes the subcommand name in `ctx.positionals`. Now correctly slices past the subcommand path to extract the variable name.

- [#356](https://github.com/dmno-dev/varlock/pull/356) [`61e2094`](https://github.com/dmno-dev/varlock/commit/61e2094f28ab9d6abcc9aefebfdd267a88dea2b2) - Add `enabled` option to `@setValuesBulk` decorator, allowing conditional bulk value injection based on boolean expressions (including dynamic expressions referencing other config items).

- [#352](https://github.com/dmno-dev/varlock/pull/352) [`0e4d39a`](https://github.com/dmno-dev/varlock/commit/0e4d39acba3707cfb30f534ed47161e64b805a00) - Support XDG Base Directory Specification for user config directory. Varlock now respects `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME` and defaults to `~/.config/varlock` instead of `~/.varlock` for new installations, while maintaining backwards compatibility with existing `~/.varlock` directories.

## 0.4.0

### Minor Changes

- [#342](https://github.com/dmno-dev/varlock/pull/342) [`e30ec1f`](https://github.com/dmno-dev/varlock/commit/e30ec1f6c193365903c734f9443dea0ae420c9bb) - Environment-independent type generation

  - Type generation now runs before env value resolution, producing deterministic TypeScript types regardless of which environment is active
  - Added `isEnvSpecific` tracking on data sources to identify environment-dependent files (`.env.production`, conditional `@disable`, conditional `@import`)
  - Items defined only in env-specific files are excluded from generated types
  - Added `auto=false` parameter to `@generateTypes` decorator to disable automatic type generation during `varlock load` and `varlock run`
  - Added `varlock typegen` command for manual type generation

Automatically detects package manager (npm, pnpm, bun, etc.) and hook managers (husky, lefthook, simple-git-hooks) for correct setup.

When multiple lockfiles are found (e.g., both package-lock.json and bun.lockb), the detection now:
  1. First tries env var based detection (npm_config_user_agent) to respect the currently active package manager
  2. If that fails, returns the first detected package manager as a fallback
  3. No longer throws an error, preventing CLI crashes in monorepos or when switching package managers
